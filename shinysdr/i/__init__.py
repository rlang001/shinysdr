"""Package for ShinySDR implementation modules.

Everything under this package is explicitly not a stable interface -- that is, not intended for use by plugins or any other kind of third-party code. It is organized according to convenience rather than API design.

(On the other hand, there aren't guarantees of stability outside this package. It's just particularly not guaranteed here.)
