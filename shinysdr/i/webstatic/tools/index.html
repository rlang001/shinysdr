<h1>ShinySDR Toolbox</h1>

<p>This is a collection of tools built on ShinySDR’s components while not being ShinySDR per se. They are usable without a ShinySDR server.</p>

<p>All of the current tools visualize audio from any of the audio input devices available to your web browser. (They do not transmit the audio to the server — or so this text claims.)</p>
