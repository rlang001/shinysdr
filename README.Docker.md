# What is GNURadio + ShinySDR?

*from the [ShinySDR GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kpreid/shinysdr "GitHub ShinySDR"):* 

>ShinySDR is the software component of a software-defined radio receiver. When combined with suitable hardware devices such as the RTL-SDR, HackRF, or USRP, it can be used to listen to or display data from a variety of radio transmissions.

*from [GNURadio.org/about](https://www.gnuradio.org/ "GNURadio")*:

>GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.

# How to use this image

### Config ShinySDR
```bash
$ mkdir ~/.shinysdr
$ docker run -it --rm -v ~/.shinysdr:/config jeffersonjhunt/shinysdr init /config/my-config
```
This will create a `.shindysdr` directory in `$HOME` and run the `--create config` command of ShinySDR. In this case the config will be named `my-config` and will be added as sub-directory of `~/.shindysdr`

Edit the `config.pl` in `~/.shinysdr/my-config` to match your requirements following the instructions at [ShinySDR Manual: Configuration and devices](https://shinysdr.switchb.org/manual/configuration "ShinySDR Manual: Configuration and devices")

### Run ShinySDR
```bash
$ docker run --rm -p 8100:8100 -p 8101:8101 -v ~/.shinysdr:/config --name shinysdr jeffersonjhunt/shinysdr start /config/my-config
```
This will run ShinySDR with the config located at `~/.shinysdr/my-config`
